# c-pointer-project

A simple program demonstrating conceptual understanding of C pointer arithmetic. It takes an array of three zeros, and using a pointer `p`, moves the pointer between indices, incrementing each value until the first three digits of Pi is reached, then starts over (the pointer is moved back to index 0), and decrements each value back to 0.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have a C compiler installed.

## How to run:

Download the `main.c` and 'makefile" files, or clone this repository. In terminal run `~$ make` (ensure the `pwd` is the same location as both files). You can then run `~$ ./output` in the terminal to run the program.
